N-Body Problem
Status Report

So far the n-body program has been coming along fairly well. As of now the C++ version of the code works very well and the
OpenCL version seems to be functioning the same. Getting the OpenCL version to work was not very straightforward and took more 
time than I was expecting. 

Things that are done:
- C++ Version w/ OpenMP
- OpenCL Version
- Camera controls via keyboard
- Switching between C++ and OpenCL and OpenMP seemlessly
- Linux compatability
- General code cleanup and relocation
- OpenMP version of CPU-based code
- Double buffering to eliminate flickering bodies
- Adjustable # of bodies // currently as command line arg

Things that need to be fixed:
- Octree

Things that will be added to final:
- O(n log n) Barnes-Hut algorithm
- OpenGL / OpenCL interop
- Mouse control
- Interesting test cases rather than random body placement

Things that would be nice to add to the final:
- Interactive placement of bodies/wells
- Visual representation of the O(n log n) algorithms on the screen
- Other computational libraries/methods
- Better visual style for the simulation (trails, forces, etc.)
