N-Body Problem
Status Report

So far the n-body program has been coming along fairly well. As of now the C++ version of the code works very well and the
OpenCL version seems to be functioning the same. Getting the OpenCL version to work was not very straightforward and took more 
time than I was expecting. 

Things that work:
- C++ Version
- OpenCL Version
- Camera controls via keyboard
- Switching between C++ and OpenCL

Things that need to be fixed:
- General code cleanup and relocation
- Linux compatability

Things that will be added to final:
- O(n log n) Barnes-Hut algorithm
- OpenGL / OpenCL interop
- Mouse control
- Interesting test cases rather than random body placement
- Adjustable # of bodies

Things that would be nice to add to the final:
- Interactive placement of bodies/wells
- Visual representation of the O(n log n) algorithms on the screen
- OpenMP or other methods
- Better visual style for the simulation (trails, forces, etc.)
